Milestone Project 2: Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project  - Code Institute

The purpose of this project is to create a single player matching memory game. I created a memory game where upon clicked, two cards match and stay open. Once all cards are matched, a popup message appears and congratulates the tester for winning the game. The popup gives a score from 1 to 3, how much time it took, and how many moves it took to finish the game.

## How to Play:

* The goal is to match all the cards together and win the game.

1. Start by clicking on two cards, if they match, look for another pair of cards. If cards are not a pair, try again.

2. Keep matching up pairs until all cards are matched and faced up. 

3. Congratulations, you win! An alert window appears tell you your score, time, and moves it took to complete the game. 

4. On the Alert window, you can hit 'Go Again!' to have another go at the game.
