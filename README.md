Milestone Project 2: Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project  - Code Institute

The purpose of this project is to create a single player matching memory game. I created a memory game where upon clicked, two cards match and stay open. Once all cards are matched, a popup message appears and congratulates the tester for winning the game. The popup gives a score from 1 to 3, how much time it took, and how many moves it took to finish the game.
